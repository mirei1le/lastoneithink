# Shopaholics E-Commerce Site

## Database Setup

To set up the database for this project:

1. Open **phpMyAdmin** (via Laragon) or **HeidiSQL**.
2. Create a new empty database called `department_store`.
3. Import the SQL file located in:
   ```
   /database/department_store.sql
   ```
4. The SQL file includes all tables and initial data required for the site to function.

> Note: This project uses **PDO** for database interaction, so make sure your PHP setup has PDO enabled.
